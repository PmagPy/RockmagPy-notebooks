# RockmagPy notebooks

🚧 **WARNING: This repository is currently under initial development and is not yet ready for research or instructional use.** 🚧

## About This Repository

This repository is for the development and demonstration of the `rockmag.py` function module. The ultimate goal is to integrate additional functionality for the analysis of rock magnetic experiments into the `pmagpy` package. To facilitate development, the initial rockmag.py module is in this repository along with notebooks that use the rockmag.py functions to visualize and analyze data.

## Notebooks

### rockmag_data_unpack

The notebook [rockmag_data_unpack.ipynb](./rockmag_data_unpack.ipynb) takes data from rock magnetic experiments that are in MagIC format and splits out the different tables. It also summarizes all of the specimens and experiments within the measurements table.

### MPMS_plotting

In this [MPMS_plotting.ipynb](./MPMS_plotting.ipynb) notebook, MPMS data within the measurements file can be plotted. This plotting includes the calculation and visualization of derivative curves.

### MPMS_verwey.ipynb

In this [MPMS_plotting.ipynb](./MPMS_plotting.ipynb) notebook, Verwey temperature estimates can be made from remanence upon warming experiments conducted on an MPMS.

### Contributing

While the repository is not yet ready for general use, contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome. _Thank you for your interest in contributing to the `rockmag.py` function library and the broader `pmagpy` project!_ 🌍🧲
