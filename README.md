## About This Repository

This repository is for the development and demonstration of the `rockmag.py` function module. The ultimate goal is to integrate additional functionality for the analysis of rock magnetic experiments into the `pmagpy` package. To facilitate development, the initial rockmag.py module is in this repository along with notebooks that use the rockmag.py functions to visualize and analyze data.

### Contributing

While the repository is not yet ready for general use, contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome. _Thank you for your interest in contributing to the `rockmag.py` function library and the broader `pmagpy` project!_ 🌍🧲
