# RockmagPy notebooks

[![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://pmagpy.github.io/RockmagPy-notebooks)

This repository is for the development and demonstration of the `rockmag.py` function module. The ultimate goal of these functions are to integrate additional functionality for the analysis of rock magnetic experiments into the `pmagpy` package. To facilitate development, the initial rockmag.py module is in this repository along with notebooks that use the rockmag.py functions to visualize and analyze data. RockmagPy will subsequently be integrated as a module within PmagPy (https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy).

The notebooks within this repository can all be seen as webpages here: https://pmagpy.github.io/RockmagPy-notebooks
