<p>In this notebook a contribution is downloaded from the MagIC database. Susceptibility-temperature, <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\chi\)</span>-T</em></span>, data contained within it are extracted. The user has the option to correct for the diamagnetic signal of the measurement instrument and holder (optional) and to smooth the data prior to further analysis (optional).</p>
<p>The notebook is to be run cell-by-cell to allow users to select corrections/filters as needed. The code below brings in example magnetite data from the rock magnetic bestiary. Any MagIC contribution which contains <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\chi\)</span>-T</em></span> data can be used in place of this example dataset.</p>

<p>Above <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>T<sub>c</sub></em></span> a mineral phase will be paramagnetic. This means that the inverse susceptibility should have a linear positive slope above <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>T<sub>c</sub></em></span>. Using the intercept temperature at 0 inverse susceptibility is a good guess for  <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><em>T<sub>c</sub></em></span>.

<h2>Determining the best temperature window for smoothing<a class="headerlink" href="#determining-the-best-temperature-window-for-smoothing" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The following function plots the <strong>model roughness</strong> against the <strong>root mean square error</strong> of the model <strong>(note that the y-axis is inverted)</strong> (a measure of the difference between the running average and the data). Each point on the graph is for a different temperature window size. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">knee</span></code> in the curve (the break of slope) can be interpreted as the optimal temperature window for smoothing. At this point (window) there is a decent trade off between the smoothness of the model (the running average) and error on the model.</p>
<p>Set values for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">min_temp_window</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">max_temp_window</span></code> to set the temperature range for exploring the rms and variance tradeoff.</p>
