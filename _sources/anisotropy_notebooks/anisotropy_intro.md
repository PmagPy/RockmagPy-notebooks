# AMS data analysis

- [**Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS)**](./anisotropy_plot_AMS.ipynb) Within this notebook, AMS data are plotted and different methods for estimating the confidence of the associated axes are implemented using functions developed by Lisa Tauxe in PmagPy.
- [**Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility (AMS) background**](../book/background/anisotropy.md) This document provides background information on AMS tensors and experimental protocols.
