### Background on low-temperature remanence experiments

Magnetic minerals, such as magnetite, hematite, and pyrrhotite, have characteristic phase transitions at low-temperatures that can be detected by changes in their remanent magnetization. By performing low-temperature remanence experiments on an instrument such as a Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS) SQUID magnetometer, rock magnetists can identify these transitions and gain insight into a specimen's magnetic mineralogy. 

Two common experimental protocols for detecting these magnetic transitions are:
– RT-SIRM cycling



Low-Temperature Remanence Experiments in Rock Magnetism

Rock magnetism often involves studying how magnetic minerals carry remanent magnetization. Certain magnetic minerals (like magnetite, hematite, and pyrrhotite) exhibit characteristic low-temperature phase transitions that alter their magnetic behavior. By performing low-temperature remanence experiments using a Magnetic Properties Measurement System (MPMS) SQUID magnetometer, graduate students can identify these transitions and understand the underlying physics. Below, we introduce two common experimental protocols – room-temperature SIRM low-temperature (LT) cycling and low-temperature SIRM warming (in both field-cooled and zero-field-cooled modes) – and discuss the key magnetic phase transitions they reveal in magnetite, hematite, and pyrrhotite.

Low-Temperature Remanence Experimental Methods (MPMS)

Modern SQUID magnetometers (e.g. MPMS) allow precise measurement of a sample’s magnetization as a function of temperature down to a few kelvins. Two widely used remanence protocols in rock magnetism are:
	•	Room-Temperature SIRM (RT-SIRM) cooling/warming: The sample is first saturated in a high magnetic field at room temperature (imparting a saturation isothermal remanent magnetization, SIRM). The field is then turned off, and the sample is cooled to low temperature (typically ~10–20 K) in zero field. Finally, the remanent magnetization is measured continuously while warming back to room temperature (zero-field warming). This cooling–warming cycle can reveal magnetic transitions as sudden changes in the remanence curve.
	•	Low-Temperature SIRM (LT-SIRM) warming (ZFC): The sample is cooled from room temperature to a low temperature (e.g. 10–20 K) in zero field. At low T, a saturating field is applied to impart a SIRM, then the field is switched off. The sample’s remanent magnetization is measured upon warming to room temperature in zero field. This zero-field-cooled remanence warming curve is sensitive to phase transitions encountered during warming (since the remanence was acquired in the low-T phase).
	•	Low-Temperature SIRM warming (FC): In the field-cooled protocol, the sample is cooled in the presence of a magnetic field (often a strong field to ensure saturation) from room temperature down to the low target temperature. The field is removed at low T, leaving the sample with a remanence acquired under field-cooled conditions. The remanence is then measured during warming. Comparing FC and ZFC warming curves can diagnose domain state and mineralogy – for example, differences between FC and ZFC remanence losses through transitions (quantified by a “δ-ratio”) are used to identify biogenic magnetite in magnetosome chains ￼.

These methods exploit how magnetic order changes with temperature. As the sample passes through certain critical temperatures, the crystal structure or spin alignment can change, causing abrupt variations in remanent magnetization. Below, we highlight the key low-temperature magnetic transitions for magnetite, hematite, and pyrrhotite – what they are, the physical mechanisms behind them, and how they appear in such experiments.

Verwey Transition in Magnetite (~120 K)

Magnetite (Fe₃O₄) undergoes the famous Verwey transition at approximately 120 K (125 K in pure stoichiometric magnetite). At the Verwey transition temperature (TV), magnetite’s crystal structure changes from a cubic inverse-spinel to a lower-symmetry (monoclinic) structure, accompanied by an ordering of Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ ions ￼ ￼. This transition was first noted by E. Verwey (1939) due to a sharp increase in electrical resistivity, and it also causes significant changes in magnetic properties like susceptibility, coercivity, and remanence ￼. In essence, the Verwey transition is a charge-ordering and structural phase change that alters magnetite’s magnetic anisotropy and domain state.

Detection in low-T experiments: In an RT-SIRM cooling/warming experiment, a magnetite-bearing sample will show a sudden drop in remanent magnetization upon warming through ~110–120 K, marking the Verwey transition. For example, a strong room-temperature SIRM will partially demagnetize when the sample warms past TV, due to the change in magnetite’s magnetic easy axes and domain configuration at the structural transition. In a 20 K LT-SIRM warming curve, stoichiometric magnetite typically exhibits a sharp inflection or peak in the derivative of remanence around 120 K ￼. If the magnetite is non-stoichiometric or partially oxidized (forming maghemite), the Verwey transition is suppressed or smeared out – often occurring at lower temperature or with diminished intensity ￼ ￼. Thus, observing a clear ~120 K feature in low-temperature remanence curves is a diagnostic “fingerprint” of magnetite; its absence or a broadened lower-T signal can indicate oxidation or cation substitution in the magnetite lattice.

Magnetite’s Isotropic Point (~130–150 K)

Around 130–150 K, pure magnetite also encounters an “isotropic point” where its first magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant (K₁) changes sign (going through zero) ￼. This is not a phase transition per se, but rather a temperature at which the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy vanishes, making all crystallographic directions equally easy for magnetization. In magnetite, the isotropic point (Ti) occurs slightly above the Verwey transition (for Fe₃O₄, Ti ≈ 130 K) ￼. The physical mechanism is related to temperature-dependent crystal-field effects on Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ that alter anisotropy constants. As temperature approaches Ti, the traditional easy axes lose their dominance.

Detection in low-T experiments: The isotropic point is most evident in remanence cooling curves. For example, when cooling a room-temperature SIRM, magnetite can lose a significant portion of its remanence upon crossing ~130 K, even before reaching the Verwey transition ￼. This occurs especially in multidomain (MD) magnetite, where the vanishing of anisotropy allows domains to reorganize freely, erasing remanent magnetization ￼. As a result, cooling in zero-field through Ti can cause a large remanence loss (demagnetization) due to domain realignment. Upon warming, this effect is less pronounced because the sample is regaining anisotropy. In practice, the presence of an isotropic point can make the Verwey-related drop appear more gradual or two-stepped in a warming curve. Researchers often warm the sample (ZFC protocol) to determine TV cleanly, since cooling curves are complicated by the Ti demagnetization ￼. Nonetheless, the ~130 K isotropic point is a notable feature of magnetite’s low-T behavior, reflecting a fundamental change in magnetic anisotropy that can be detected by a large change in remanent magnetization or a peak in magnetic susceptibility.

Morin Transition in Hematite (~260 K)

Hematite (α-Fe₂O₃) exhibits the Morin transition at TM ≈ 250–260 K (just below room temperature) ￼. Discovered by F.J. Morin (1950), this transition is a spin-reorientation (spin-flop) transition in this canted antiferromagnetic material. Below TM (~250 K), hematite’s iron spins are aligned along the crystal’s trigonal c-axis (the “easy” axis at low T), with pairs of spins exactly antiparallel, resulting in a purely antiferromagnetic state (no net moment) ￼. Above TM, the spins rotate by 90° into the basal plane of the rhombohedral lattice, where a slight canting of the antiparallel spins produces a weak ferromagnetic (WF) moment ￼. In other words, hematite is an antiferromagnet at low temperatures and becomes a canted antiferromagnet (weak ferromagnet) at higher temperatures. This spin flop is driven by competing magnetic anisotropies: a single-ion anisotropy favoring the c-axis alignment at low T, and a dipole or shape anisotropy favoring basal-plane alignment at higher T ￼. As temperature increases, the balance of these anisotropies shifts, causing the abrupt reorientation of spins at the Morin transition.

Detection in low-T experiments: The Morin transition produces a dramatic change in hematite’s magnetic remanence. If a sample with hematite is given a saturation remanence at 300 K (where hematite has a weak ferromagnetic moment), and then cooled in zero field, the remanent magnetization will plummet as the sample passes below ~260 K. In fact, nearly all of the hematite’s remanence is lost in the AF state – experiments show that only on the order of 1–5% of the original 300 K remanence survives upon cooling below TM ￼. This is because the spins lock into the strictly antiparallel arrangement, eliminating the net moment. The tiny remanence that remains below TM is attributed to defects or impurities that allow a small “frozen-in” canted moment (often called the defect moment of hematite) ￼. When the sample is warmed back up through TM in zero field, the remanence curve shows a sharp increase at ~260 K as hematite’s weak ferromagnetism reappears. Interestingly, about one-third of the original magnetization can be recovered upon warming through the Morin transition, even though it had largely vanished on cooling ￼. This partial recovery is a memory effect: it occurs because some fraction of the spins, pinned by crystal imperfections, realign along the original magnetization direction once the weak-ferromagnetic phase is restored ￼. In practice, a pronounced drop in a sample’s remanence or magnetic susceptibility around 250–260 K (with thermal hysteresis between cooling and warming) is a clear signature of hematite’s Morin transition ￼ ￼. Recognizing this transition is important, as it distinguishes hematite from other iron oxides and provides insight into grain size and defect effects on its magnetic state.

Besnus Transition in Pyrrhotite (~30–50 K)

Pyrrhotite refers to a group of iron sulfide minerals (Fe1−xS) that are often ferrimagnetic. The most common magnetic form in rocks is monoclinic 4C pyrrhotite (Fe₇S₈), which is a strong remanence carrier. This mineral exhibits a low-temperature magnetic transition around 30–34 K, known as the Besnus transition (named after J. Besnus, who studied it in the 1960s) ￼. At the Besnus transition, there is no change in crystal structure as drastic as a phase change to a new mineral, but there is a subtle crystallographic and magnetic rearrangement: evidence suggests a slight lowering of symmetry (from the monoclinic structure toward triclinic) or a reordering of the Fe-vacancy superstructure occurs around this temperature ￼. This leads to changes in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and magnetic domain state. In essence, the Besnus transition likely stems from an internal structural adjustment in Fe₇S₈ that alters how the spins are aligned or how domain walls behave at low temperature ￼ ￼. Some recent studies propose that two competing anisotropy systems (arising from the complex vacancy ordering) interact below ~35 K, causing a spin disorder or anisotropy change that manifests as the Besnus transition ￼. Importantly, this transition is an intrinsic property of monoclinic pyrrhotite and does not occur in non-magnetic or hexagonal forms of Fe-S.

Detection in low-T experiments: The Besnus transition is most famously marked by a pronounced drop in remanent magnetization at ~30–32 K. For example, if a rock sample containing monoclinic pyrrhotite is cooled to 10 K and given a SIRM, the subsequent warming curve (ZFC) will show a clear decrease in magnetization as the temperature passes through the low-30s K. This sudden decrease in isothermal remanence around 30–32 K is a characteristic trait used to identify 4C pyrrhotite in rock samples ￼. In fact, rock magnetists often use the presence of this ~32 K drop (on warming a low-T SIRM or cooling a RT-SIRM) as a diagnostic “flag” for pyrrhotite ￼. The change is sharp: at TBesnus, pyrrhotite’s remanence and magnetic susceptibility typically show an abrupt kink or inflection. The underlying mechanism is the change in magnetic anisotropy – below the Besnus point, the magnetization might reconfigure (e.g. spin axis reorientation or domain wall pinning changes), causing part of the previously locked-in remanence to release. If a field is applied during cooling or warming through this transition, pyrrhotite can acquire a transition remanent magnetization (similar to a thermal remanence but associated with the phase transition) ￼. In zero-field warming, one simply observes the loss of magnetization acquired in one phase as it transitions to the next. The Besnus transition does not typically result in a complete demagnetization (since pyrrhotite remains ferrimagnetic on both sides of the transition), but it is a noticeable partial loss or change in slope of the magnetization-vs-T curve. Because of its diagnostic nature, the ~30 K drop in remanence is routinely used to confirm the presence of monoclinic pyrrhotite ￼. This transition, along with the Verwey and Morin transitions, forms one of the key low-temperature magnetic signatures in rock magnetism.

Summary of Key Transitions and Their Significance

In summary, low-temperature remanence cycling experiments on an MPMS are powerful tools for detecting mineral-specific magnetic transitions:
	•	Magnetite shows the Verwey transition (~120 K) as a sharp change in remanence due to a crystal structure change, and an anisotropy isotropic point (~130 K) where multidomain magnetite can lose magnetization due to easy-axis collapse ￼. These features help confirm magnetite and even assess its stoichiometry (a lowered or absent Verwey transition indicates oxidation or non-stoichiometry ￼ ￼).
	•	Hematite exhibits the Morin transition (~260 K), where it switches from weakly ferromagnetic to purely antiferromagnetic. This appears as a nearly complete loss of remanence on cooling and a recovery on warming ￼ ￼. Identifying TM is crucial for recognizing hematite in mixtures and understanding its grain size and defect effects ￼ ￼.
	•	Pyrrhotite (Fe₇S₈) is identified by the Besnus transition (~30–32 K) – a distinctive low-T remanence drop signaling the internal ordering change of monoclinic pyrrhotite ￼. This allows geoscientists to detect even small amounts of pyrrhotite in rocks, which is important since pyrrhotite carries paleomagnetic signals (and can indicate ore-forming processes or metamorphic history).

By understanding the physical mechanisms (structural phase transitions, spin reorientation, anisotropy changes) underlying these phenomena, graduate students can interpret low-temperature magnetization curves to deduce a rock’s magnetic mineralogy. Each transition offers a window into the mineral’s crystal structure and magnetic anisotropy: e.g. the Verwey transition reflects electron ordering in magnetite ￼, the Morin transition reflects spin-axis energetics in hematite ￼, and the Besnus transition reflects vacancy ordering in pyrrhotite ￼. Together, RT-SIRM and LT-SIRM (FC/ZFC) experiments provide a cornerstone in rock magnetism for linking magnetic measurements to mineralogical identity and domain state – a foundation for robust paleomagnetic and environmental magnetic interpretations.

 room-temperature SIRM low-temperature (LT) cycling and low-temperature SIRM warming (in both field-cooled and zero-field-cooled modes) – and discuss the key magnetic phase transitions they reveal in magnetite, hematite, and pyrrhotite.

Low-temperature remanence experiments – such as cooling and warming a room-temperature saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (RT-SIRM) or imparting a low-temperature SIRM and warming it – are powerful tools for probing magnetic phase transitions in minerals using a MPMS SQUID magnetometer. In a typical low-temperature SIRM warming experiment, a sample is cooled (in zero field) to cryogenic temperatures, given a strong remanence, and then warmed back to room temperature while measuring magnetization; any abrupt drops in remanence at specific temperatures signify magnetic transition points. Conversely, in an RT-SIRM low-temperature cycling (LTD) experiment, a sample is magnetized at room temperature and then cooled to a low temperature (e.g. ~20 K) in zero field before rewarming, which can progressively reduce the remanence as the material passes through one or more transitions [oai_citation_attribution:0‡file-7xhafhmrx8a84s69qk4395](file://file-7xHaFhMrx8A84S69qk4395#:~:text=mysteries,130K%20%28from). Such low-temperature cycling and warming methods are widely used in rock magnetism to detect diagnostic phase transitions and thus identify mineral components in a sample [oai_citation_attribution:1‡file-fxn4fqpzbg5rwsqv63cwvp](file://file-FXN4FQPZBg5rwSQV63CWVP#:~:text=The%20Verwey%20transition%20is%20widely,spite%20of%20these%20useful%20applications).

## Magnetite (Verwey Transition & Isotropic Point)
**Magnetite (Fe₃O₄)** undergoes two closely spaced transitions in the 100–150 K range. Around ~130 K, magnetite reaches an *isotropic point* (T<sub>i</sub>) at which the first magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant (K₁) drops to zero and changes sign [oai_citation_attribution:2‡file-fxn4fqpzbg5rwsqv63cwvp](file://file-FXN4FQPZBg5rwSQV63CWVP#:~:text=a%20slightly%20higher%20temperature%20%28,easily%20identified%20by%20magnetic%20mea).  At this T<sub>i</sub>, the easy axis of magnetization shifts from the cubic ⟨111⟩ directions at higher temperatures to the ⟨100⟩ (cube-edge) directions in the lower-temperature phase [oai_citation_attribution:3‡file-fxn4fqpzbg5rwsqv63cwvp](file://file-FXN4FQPZBg5rwSQV63CWVP#:~:text=a%20slightly%20higher%20temperature%20%28,easily%20identified%20by%20magnetic%20mea). Upon further cooling to the Verwey transition (T<sub>V</sub> ≈ 120 K), magnetite undergoes a crystal structure change from cubic to monoclinic symmetry, accompanied by a sharp increase in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and a drop in electrical conductivity [oai_citation_attribution:4‡file-fxn4fqpzbg5rwsqv63cwvp](file://file-FXN4FQPZBg5rwSQV63CWVP#:~:text=We%20now%20know%20,the%20easy%20directions%20of%20magnetiza) [oai_citation_attribution:5‡file-l3byjrv6xkbychu9nkcexe](file://file-L3bYjrV6xKbYCHu9NKCexE#:~:text=Verwey%20transition%20there%20is%20a,ing%20additional%20roles). This Verwey transition produces abrupt changes in magnetic properties – for example, a low-temperature SIRM will typically lose a large fraction of its magnetization upon warming through ~120 K as the strong low-temperature anisotropy vanishes [oai_citation_attribution:6‡file-7xhafhmrx8a84s69qk4395](file://file-7xHaFhMrx8A84S69qk4395#:~:text=mysteries,130K%20%28from). The Verwey transition is often readily identified in such experiments and is widely used as a diagnostic signature of magnetite (e.g. for non-destructive mineral identification or low-temperature demagnetization of multi-domain magnetite) [oai_citation_attribution:7‡file-fxn4fqpzbg5rwsqv63cwvp](file://file-FXN4FQPZBg5rwSQV63CWVP#:~:text=the%20transition%20is%20often%20easily,spite%20of%20these%20useful%20applications).

## Hematite (Morin Transition)
**Hematite (α-Fe₂O₃)** exhibits the Morin transition at approximately 250–260 K [oai_citation_attribution:8‡file-dyjpe1eznknvyn9zpygnfb](file://file-DYJPE1EZNKNvyn9ZPYgnFb#:~:text=method%20may%20be%20preferred%2C%20in,what%20%20%20%20happens).  Above the Morin transition (T<sub>M</sub>), hematite’s antiferromagnetically coupled spins are slightly canted out of perfect antiparallel alignment, producing a weak in-plane magnetization (a “parasitic” ferromagnetism in the basal plane perpendicular to the c-axis) [oai_citation_attribution:9‡file-dyjpe1eznknvyn9zpygnfb](file://file-DYJPE1EZNKNvyn9ZPYgnFb#:~:text=transition%20%20%20%20,plane%20%20%20into). As the temperature cools to T<sub>M</sub> ≈ 260 K, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy flips sign and the spin axes rotate to align with the hexagonal c-axis, eliminating the basal-plane canting and thus extinguishing the net magnetic moment [oai_citation_attribution:10‡file-dyjpe1eznknvyn9zpygnfb](file://file-DYJPE1EZNKNvyn9ZPYgnFb). Below T<sub>M</sub> the material is a practically pure antiferromagnet – the small remanent magnetization above T<sub>M</sub> vanishes, aside from any minor “defect ferromagnetism” that may remain due to crystal imperfections [oai_citation_attribution:11‡file-dyjpe1eznknvyn9zpygnfb](file://file-DYJPE1EZNKNvyn9ZPYgnFb#:~:text=sublattice%20%20%20%20,tism%E2%80%9D). Observing a sharp change in magnetization at ~260 K (for instance, a sudden drop in a warming SIRM curve) is therefore diagnostic of hematite in a sample [oai_citation_attribution:12‡file-dyjpe1eznknvyn9zpygnfb](file://file-DYJPE1EZNKNvyn9ZPYgnFb#:~:text=method%20may%20be%20preferred%2C%20in,what%20%20%20%20happens). Indeed, identifying the Morin transition in low-temperature magnetic scans provides a convenient, non-destructive way to recognize hematite [oai_citation_attribution:13‡file-dyjpe1eznknvyn9zpygnfb](file://file-DYJPE1EZNKNvyn9ZPYgnFb#:~:text=and%20its%20presence%20is%20often,what%20%20%20%20happens). Moreover, because natural samples at high latitudes or elevations may cycle through ~260 K frequently, understanding the Morin transition’s effect on remanence is important for paleomagnetic interpretations [oai_citation_attribution:14‡file-dyjpe1eznknvyn9zpygnfb](file://file-DYJPE1EZNKNvyn9ZPYgnFb#:~:text=at%20%20%20%20,for%20paleomagnetic%20%20%20interpretations).

## Pyrrhotite (Besnus Transition)
**Monoclinic pyrrhotite (Fe₇S₈)** – a common magnetic iron sulfide – undergoes a subtle low-temperature transition in the ~30–50 K range, often called the *Besnus transition* (after M.-J. Besnus, who first documented it) [oai_citation_attribution:15‡file-c7bhyfyjcfusxs1qfvzpqn](file://file-C7bHyFyjCFUsXS1qFvzpqN#:~:text=clear%20in%20that%20text%20that,During). This transition was originally recognized by the coincidence of anomalies in three independent properties (induced magnetization, electrical resistivity, and specific heat) around ~30 K, implying the onset of a distinct phase change in the mineral [oai_citation_attribution:16‡file-c7bhyfyjcfusxs1qfvzpqn](file://file-C7bHyFyjCFUsXS1qFvzpqN#:~:text=30%20K%20by%20Gronvold%20et,was%20present%20near%2030%20K). The Besnus transition is evidenced by a small inflection or “hump” in the magnetization-vs-temperature curve of pyrrhotite upon cooling or warming through ~32 K [oai_citation_attribution:17‡file-c7bhyfyjcfusxs1qfvzpqn](file://file-C7bHyFyjCFUsXS1qFvzpqN#:~:text=30%20K%20by%20Gronvold%20et,was%20present%20near%2030%20K). Though its magnetic signature is more subtle than the Verwey or Morin transitions, detecting this 30–32 K anomaly is a telltale indicator of monoclinic pyrrhotite in a sample [oai_citation_attribution:18‡file-c7bhyfyjcfusxs1qfvzpqn](file://file-C7bHyFyjCFUsXS1qFvzpqN#:~:text=30%20K%20by%20Gronvold%20et,was%20present%20near%2030%20K). Identification of the Besnus transition in laboratory cooling/warming experiments thus helps confirm the presence of pyrrhotite, complementing other low-temperature tests for distinguishing iron oxides and sulfides.
