Superparamagnetism (SP) describes the state of a single-domain-sized grain when thermal energy is sufficient to overcome barriers to a reversal of magnetization. Here the term “reversal” assumes uniaxial anisotropy with two minimum energy states having anti-parallel moment orientations. Energy barriers to magnetization changing arise from magnetocrystalline, magnetoelastic and/or shape anisotropy, all of which are proportional to grain volume (V). When the energy barriers are large with respect to thermal energy, the magnetization is “blocked” and the probability of spontaneous reversal approaches nil. But when the barriers are relatively low, thermal excitations can result in reversal of the magnetization over very short time scales, and the grain is in a superparamagnetic state. At a given temperature the volume at which a particle goes from being unblocked to blocked is known as the blocking volume (V<sub>b</sub>). For a given volume, we can block the grain by lowering the temperature (i.e. decreasing the available thermal energy) below the blocking temperature (T<sub>b</sub>).

More formally, we can think about SP blocking in terms of a particle’s characteristic relaxation time (τ) and how rapidly a particle or assemblage of particles may approach equilibrium. Based on Néel theory of thermally activated magnetization (Néel, 1949) and the terminology of Dunlop and Özdemir (1997), the equilibrium magnetization \(M\) for aligned, uniaxial grains is given by:

\[
M_{\mathrm{eq}}(H_{0}, T) \;=\; M_{s}\,\tanh(\alpha),
\]
where \(\alpha = \frac{\mu_{0}\,M_{s}\,H_{0}\,V}{k_{B}\,T}\). For small \(\alpha\),  
\[
M_{\mathrm{eq}} \;\approx\; M_{s}\,\alpha.
\]

The relaxation time \(\tau\) in weak or zero field is:
 
\[
\tau \;=\; \tau_{0}\,\exp\!\Bigl(\frac{K\,V}{k_{B}\,T}\Bigr),
\]
where \(M_{s}\) is the saturation magnetization, \(\mu_{0}\) is the permeability of free space, \(H_{0}\) is a (weak) applied field, and \(\tau_{0}\) is a time constant related to the atomic reorganization time (on the order of \(10^{-9}\) s). \(K\) is an anisotropy constant also related to particle microcoercivity.
