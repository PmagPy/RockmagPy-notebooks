# RockmagPy: tools for rock magnetic data analysis

RockmagPy is a module of the [PmagPy](https://pmagpy.github.io/PmagPy-docs/intro.html) tools written in Python that is focused on the analysis of rock magnetic data. The functions within RockmagPy facilitate the visualization and interpretation of the results from experiments such as hysteresis loops, low-temperature remenance experiments, and thermomagnetic curves. 

RockmagPy is designed to work with the [MagIC database](https://earthref.org/MagIC). It enables manipulation of MagIC data sets as well as preparation of contributions for uploading to MagIC. Example notebooks have been developed to aid in the use of RockmagPy and to enable well-documented data analysis. These notebooks can be downloaded from the [RockmagPy notebooks repository](https://github.com/pmagpy/rockmagpy-notebooks) to be run locally on one's computer or run in the cloud on the [EarthRef JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.earthref.org/).

## Jupyter notebooks using RockmagPy

Notebooks have been developed to use RockmagPy to analyze data from rock magnetic experiments.
The notebook versions that are shown within this book are static (i.e. they don't run the code).
Some of the interactive features that have been developed are not visible as they would be in a running notebook. 
The rendered notebooks do give an overall sense of what functions are available within RockmagPy and explain some associated methods.

### Code/data nuts and bolts notebooks

- [**RockmagPy set-up**](./rockmag_set_up.ipynb) This notebook can be imported into JupyterHub (like the EarthRef JupyterHub) and be used to import the latest code and notebooks from Github.
- [**Rockmag MagIC data unpack**](./rockmag_data_unpack.ipynb) This notebook takes data from rock magnetic experiments that are in MagIC format and splits out the different MagIC tables. It also summarizes all the specimens and associated experiments within the measurements table.
