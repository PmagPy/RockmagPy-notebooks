# The Rock Magnetic Bestiary

The Rock Magnetic Bestiary is a curated collection of rock magnetic data focused on well-characterized synthetic and natural materials. Inspired by medieval bestiaries that cataloged natural entities through allegorical descriptions, the Rock Magnetic Bestiary aims facilitate the interpretation of the magnetic properties of natural samples by comparison with detailed reference datasets.

This dataset is a portion of the Rock Magnetic Bestiary (RMB Minerals â€” RMB carbonates) focused on carbonates that specifically contains data from siderite.
