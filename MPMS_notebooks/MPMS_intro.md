# MPMS data analysis

These notebooks support the analysis of low-temperature experimental data conducted on a Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS).

- [**MPMS Data Plotting (DC)**](./MPMS_plot_dc.ipynb) Within this notebook, MPMS experiments where remanence was measured upon warming and cooling are plotted. This plotting includes the calculation and visualization of derivative curves.
- [**MPMS Data Plotting (AC)**](./MPMS_plot_ac.ipynb) Within this notebook, low-temperature AC susceptibility data are visualized including in-phase and out-of-phase susceptibility.
- [**Verwey Transition Fitting**](./MPMS_verwey_fit.ipynb) Within this notebook, Verwey temperature estimates can be made from remanence upon warming experiments conducted on an MPMS.
- [**Goethite Component Fitting**](./MPMS_geothite_fit.ipynb) Within this notebook, the reversible component of room-temperature to low-temperature cycling experiments (that can be attributed to minerals such as goethite) can be numerically fit and removed.
